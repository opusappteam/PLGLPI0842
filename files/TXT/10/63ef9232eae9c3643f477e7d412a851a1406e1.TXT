Dear Mr. Bhasker ,
 
I have been trying to call your mobile but the voicemail mention that the number is not available.
Kindly just take note that we are still waiting for the ibm form before we can have the machine 
to be send for repair.
 
Will really appreciate if you were to send it as soon as possible cause I can’t have the machine to 
be hold for long.
 
have a nice day :)
